## Overview
This study examines the factors that shaped support for the United States of America's Presidential Candidates, Joeseph Biden and Donald J. Trump, during the 2020 federal election. Analyzing identity-based, socio-economic, and regional variables, we discovered that factors such as gender, age, race, education level, employment status, income, region, urban status, and specific state affiliations significantly influenced voter preferences. Our findings reveal that higher education levels and unemployment were positively associated with support for Biden, while older age groups, males, and certain racial demographics showed varied levels of support between the candidates. Regionally, urban areas and specific states like the District of Columbia showed stronger preferences for Biden, highlighting the geographical and socio-economic divides within the electorate. These insights offer a comprehensive understanding of the 2020 election dynamics, enabling more informed predictions for the upcoming 2024 election (for which many analysts predict the same candidates). This research contributes to a better grasp of American political affiliations, assisting citizens and policymakers in adapting to evolving electoral trends.
